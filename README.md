# ðŸš— Distracted Driver Detection

A deep learning project to detect distracted driving behaviors from images and videos using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This system classifies whether a driver is focused or distracted (e.g., texting, talking on the phone, eating, etc.), aiming to improve road safety.

# ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Detects multiple distracted driver behaviors
âœ… Built with TensorFlow/Keras CNN model
âœ… Trained on State Farm Distracted Driver Dataset
âœ… Includes real-time video simulation (Colab)
âœ… Streamlit app for easy deployment & demo
âœ… Organized folder structure for easy navigation
